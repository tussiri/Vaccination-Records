Transmission intensity varies from one municipality to another and is higher in jungle-mining areas, in agricultural settlements, in indigenous areas, and in some peripheral urban areas, including the large cities of Cruzeiro do Sul, Manaus, Porto Velho, Boa Vista, Macapa, Maraba and Rio Branco. P. vivax and P. falciparum are cocirculating in the above-mentioned areas. P. falciparum circulating in Brazil is resistant to chloroquine, hence
the use of this drug for chemoprophylactic purposes is not recommended. In the states outside the administrative region of Amazonas, the risk of malaria transmission is negligible or non-existent, but there is a residual risk of P. vivax transmission in Atlantic forest areas of the states of Sao Paulo, Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro and Espirito Santo. Detailed information on the epidemiological situation of malaria in Brazil is available at www.saude.gov.br/malaria.
